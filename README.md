My first game - made with java

It's a work in progress, you can now just move two characters

There isn't gravity yet, will be added in future

You can't actually event yet, you lose hp if you touch the enemy and press Enter/Space



**Move Player1:** WASD + Space for attack animation

**Move Player2:** Arrow up, down, left, right + Enter for attack animation
